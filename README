SYNOPSIS
    mkovpn [-h] ACTION ARG ...

OPTIONS
    -h      Display this help.

ACTIONS
    create CLIENT_NAME
            Create a certificate, secret key, and VPN profile for a client.

    update { CLIENT_NAME | -all }
            Regenerate VPN profile for a client, using existing
            certificate and secret key. When "-all" is specified,
            regenerate the profiles for all current clients.

    revoke CLIENT_NAME
            Revoke the certificate and secret key for a client, invalidate
            the profile, and generate a new CRL (certificate revocation list)
            for the OpenVPN server.

DESCRIPTION
    The CLIENT_NAME argument can be either a fully qualified hostname
    (such as "workstation.example.com") or a descriptive phrase (such as
    "Francis Laptop").

    The OpenVPN client profile (OVPN file) will be stored in the
    "/home/chip/Workspace/mkovpn/clients" directory, named after the CLIENT_NAME with an
    ".ovpn" filetype.
