NAME
    mkovpn - manage OpenVPN client profile (.ovpn) files

SYNOPSIS
    ./mkovpn [-h] ACTION ARG ...

OPTIONS
    -h      Display this help.

ACTIONS
    create CLIENT_NAME
            Create a certificate, secret key, and VPN profile for a client.

    update { CLIENT_NAME | -all }
            Regenerate VPN profile for a client, using existing
            certificate and secret key. When "-all" is specified,
            regenerate the profiles for all current clients.

    revoke CLIENT_NAME
            Revoke the certificate and secret key for a client, invalidate
            the profile, and generate a new CRL (certificate revocation
            list) for the OpenVPN server.

DESCRIPTION
    mkovpn manages VPN profiles (.ovpn files) for your OpenVPN clients.
    It works on top of the "Easy RSA" package, a certificate authority (CA)
    that's distributed with OpenVPN.

    The basic operations are: create, update, and revoke.

    The CLIENT_NAME argument can be either a fully qualified hostname
    (such as "workstation.example.com") or a descriptive phrase (such as
    "Francis Laptop").

    The OpenVPN client profile will be stored in the "/home/chip/Workspace/mkovpn/clients"
    directory, named after the CLIENT_NAME with an ".ovpn" filetype.
    For instance, "Francis Laptop.ovpn".
